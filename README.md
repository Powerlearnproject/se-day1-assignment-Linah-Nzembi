#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic appllication of engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
Its importance to the societyis enebling creation creation of software applications and systems that power different aspects of modern life including communication and health.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The first milestone is the development of programming languages.This includes Fortran and C which are structured programming languages.
The estalishment of software engineering as a discipline.
The advent of structured programming and the rise of agile methodologies. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement -Gathering and documenting user need and system requirement
Design-Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation-writing code and building software according to the design specifications
Testing-Conducting various tests to ensure that the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements 
Deployment-releasing the software to customers and users
Maintanance-providing ongoing suppport,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodoligies is sequential approach with distinct phases such as safety critical systems like aerospace while agile methodologies are iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility.An example is a project with unclear requirements

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test  plans.
Project Manager-Oversees the planning,execution  and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- It provides  comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code example is Visual Studio.
VCS-Used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members example Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing:Testing individual components or functions in isolation.
Developers write and run tests for small, specific pieces of code.
Importance:
Catches bugs early in the development process
Ensures individual parts of the code work as expected
Facilitates refactoring and maintenance
Serves as documentation for how code should behave

Integration Testing:Testing how different components or modules work together.
Combines individually tested units and tests their interactions.
Importance:
Identifies interface defects between components
Ensures different parts of the system communicate correctly
Verifies that integrated components meet functional requirements

System Testing:Testing the entire system as a whole.
Evaluates the complete, integrated software system against specified requirements.
Importance:Validates that the entire system meets business and technical requirements
Identifies issues that may not be apparent when testing individual components
Ensures the system works in its intended environment

Acceptance Testing:Determining if the system satisfies acceptance criteria.
Often performed by end-users or clients to verify the system meets their needs.
Importance:
Ensures the system meets business requirements and user expectations
Validates usability and functionality from the user's perspective
Identifies any issues that may have been missed in previous testing phases

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Prompt engineering helps by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague question-Tell about cakes
Tell me step by step way  how to bake a one Kg of black forest cake and all the ingredients required.
Its clear- step by step way to bake 
specific- one KG blackforest cake
concise - ingredients required
